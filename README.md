# DataProcessing
## How to use
Run program in any Java enviroment. The program is interactive through the terminal, so all transactions are done through text propmts and responses. Each method corresponds to a numerical value when prompted to run a command: 1 for get, 2 for begin transaction, 3 for put, 4 for commit, 5 for rollback, and 6 to end the program. Any action that needs to be done during a transaction being done outside of a transaction (put, rollback, commit) will throw and IllegalStateException and end the program. The same thing will occur if begin transcation is called while a transaction is already active.
## Reccomendations
One recommendation for this assignment is to have be a uniform langauge like Java or React to make it easier to grade. Because langauge and set up are at the discretion of the student, there is not a uniform testing shell that graders can quickly paste the submitted code into. This can be solved by providing a template to work off of similar to any of the assignemnts that used to react counter. Another thing is instead of asking that the program throws an error, it can just tell the user they did something they weren't supposed to. This would stop the graders from needing to start the program over each time they want ot use it.
